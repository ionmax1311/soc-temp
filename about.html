                <h2 class="content-block__title">How Zovirella Was Born</h2>
                <p class="content-block__text">
                    Zovirella was created by a team of gaming enthusiasts and tech innovators who shared 
                    a common concern: <strong>too many people were getting hurt by real-money gaming</strong>. 
                    We saw friends, family members, and countless others fall into cycles of financial loss 
                    and emotional distress because they couldn't resist the lure of "just one more spin."
                </p>
                <p class="content-block__text">
                    That's when we asked ourselves: <em>What if we could capture the excitement of these games 
                    without any of the risk?</em> What if we built a platform where people could experience the 
                    same joy, the same beautiful visuals, the same engaging mechanics‚Äîbut without ever having 
                    to spend a single dollar or worry about losing their savings?
                </p>
                <p class="content-block__text">
                    From that question, <strong>Zovirella</strong> was born. Our name combines the playful 
                    spirit of our candy-themed universe with a commitment to creating something truly special. 
                    We've poured our hearts into building a platform that celebrates the artistry and entertainment 
                    value of gaming while completely removing the financial element that makes traditional operations 
                    so dangerous.
